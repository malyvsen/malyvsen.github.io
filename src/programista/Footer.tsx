        And… who’s this guy lecturing you on machine learning like he knows what
        he’s saying?

        I’m a self-taught AI researcher. I started programming when I was 10
        years old with the help of a fun little piece entitled “A noob’s guide
        to virus making” (I didn’t know what “noob” meant anyway, and I wanted
        to hack the school computer). It tends to impress people that I worked
        at Microsoft, but I honestly like startups way better.
